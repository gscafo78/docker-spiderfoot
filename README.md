**SpiderFoot** is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. It integrates with just about every data source available and utilises a range of methods for data analysis, making that data easy to navigate. 

SpiderFoot has an embedded web-server for providing a clean and intuitive web-based interface but can also be used completely via the command-line.  It's written in **Python 3** and **MIT-licensed**.
